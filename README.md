# RL-Experiments

The motivation of this project is to compare and modify deep reinforcement learning algorithms easily **for experiments**. So it is not highly modularized.

# Implemented algorithms
* DQN
* TRPO

# Dependency
> Tested in macOS 10.13
* Python 2.7.10
* OpenAI gym 0.10.3
* PyTorch 0.3.0
